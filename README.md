This application will allow the user to access the camera of the device they are using and take a picture. This picture will then be displayed at the bottom of the screen. 

The user will also be able to access the image gallery of the device and select a picture from there that will be displayed on the main screen. (The user will be able to crop the image to size)

Some of the code and logic used in the application is from the official cordova websites documentation for the camera plugin.
